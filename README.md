# Appointment-Attendance-Data-Analysis
In this project I will be analyzing the dataset of "Appointment Attendence" that contains information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.<br>
We are interested in the characteristics of patients that show up to their appointment and conversely the ones who do not.
